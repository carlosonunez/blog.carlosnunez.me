Random thoughts about my experience:

- This is MUCH nicer than it was in 2016
- CMD+TAB actually works this time...and it is super fluid!
- I think having a Mac mini at home to SSH into helps a lot...need to see how this
  works with AWS instances
- Blink terminal is FUCKING NICE. No GUI, just terminal. I LOVE IT.
- Keyboard is cramped af with the 11. Need to see if 12.9 is better...but afraid that it's too big
- Screen is really REALLY sharp and pretty readable.
- LOVING the trackpad on this thing.
- THIS PENCIL HAS AN ERASER!
- Screen tilt is really nice. I love the dual-hinge solution they came up with (one hinge
  to open the iPad clamshell; another to lift and tilt the iPad almost like an iMac monitor.
- I'm also afraid of dropping this because it's so tiny on my lap.
